# Blender iPad development

## Goal clarification: usability over a fixed UI mechanism

Follow the goal clarification in `docs/PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md` (or
`PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md` from this docs directory). It supersedes wording below
that treats a particular rail, panel or lock mechanism as immutable. Preserve the
underlying capabilities and lessons; improve the design when evidence supports a
better iPad interaction. Preserve the working Pencil mappings and external input.
Judge progress by complete workflows in installable builds and actual-device
acceptance, while continuing unfinished workspace and Files requirements.

## Updated goal — 2026-09-21

The user explicitly requested updating the goal after reviewing progress. The
success criterion is comfortable everyday iPad use while preserving full Blender
capability and external input. Follow the revised Goal and user section in
`docs/PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md`. Prioritize visible workflow improvements in coherent,
installable builds; the workspace feature list remains required but does not by
itself establish usability. Preserve the confirmed working Pencil squeeze radial.
Own reversible decisions and ask for device evidence only when needed.

The latest successful feature IPA remains run `35837932326` at source `e7cce60`;
it includes saved-layout history, exact-edge joins, the recovery guard and distinct
restore-history labels. Its artifact identity and checksum are in PROJECT_HANDOFF.
Current source `5e11388` fixes the Save As/Save Copy callback lifetime through a
live Blender modal event; host tests and pinned-source preflight pass, but its iOS
build is pending. Earlier native build failures at `56f5e23` (stale patch hunk
count), `1057ce3` (32-bit `ScrArea_Runtime` alignment) and `35833932550` (layout
patch hunk count) were fixed; do not retry those SHAs. Actual iPad acceptance is
still open. Validate the latest successful IPA's Inspector and layout workflows,
then test the new Files lifecycle in its own exact-source IPA. Continue unfinished
workspace and Files requirements.

## Latest user refinement — perceptible iPad usability, 2026-09-20

The user reports that the last successful build still feels like desktop Blender
with a little touch added. Their recording shows touch launchers opening dense
native Inspector contents and a narrow icon-only category strip. Pencil squeeze
and the existing radial tools work; preserve them. Own reversible design choices
without asking the user to specify the interface or manage implementation.

Prioritize a visibly more usable Inspector: a labeled current-category selector,
large labeled category choices, and full-width native property contents. Keep
native context filtering, search, pinning, editor state and advanced panels. This
refines the existing workspace contract; it does not replace Blender's editors or
remove the remaining splits, layout reversal, input and Files requirements.
Source implementation, host preview, packaged iOS build and device acceptance
must remain distinct. Judge further changes by common tasks on the device.

## Latest user refinement — left rail, global lock and working splits

Latest feedback: the permanent Layout button is rejected and reportedly
interferes with native bottom-panel tabs (Sculpt General/Paint/Simulation).
Remove it from the permanent rail, preserve discoverable workspace editing,
and verify native tab input ownership. Independent subagent UX reviews are
authorized; use them to challenge design and input assumptions.

This section supersedes older right-side Tools/footer launcher/per-edge pin wording.
Keep permanent matching vertical rails on both edges. Tools and bottom-editor/brush
launchers belong on the **left**. Tools opens the actual native narrow vertical
toolbar independently; bottom editors and shelves still open at the **bottom** and
must not overlap Tools. Native Item/Tool/View categories, Scene (Outliner), Inspector
(Properties) and supporting side editors stay on the **right**.

Use one always-reachable circular global panel lock beneath the native navigation
buttons, with an equivalent control in editors lacking that stack. It locks Tools,
side and bottom content together, including panels opened after locking. Switching
content preserves the global lock; unlocking restores ordinary dismissal. Remove
the footer launcher and pin controls. Keep native editor contents and useful saved
sizes; the status bar resumes its original purpose.

Preserve working-editor splits instead of reducing every workspace to one canvas.
Provide horizontal/vertical split, two-axis resizing and panel reordering through
touch-usable controls. These are part of the requested outcome; do not report the
milestone complete after relocating buttons alone. The native Pan/Move navigation
button must accept Pencil press-and-drag just as Zoom does, while preserving direct
finger navigation, external pointer input and the approved radial/Pencil mappings.


Before changing code, read `docs/PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md`, `docs/IPAD_WORKSPACE.md`
and the newest section of `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`, then inspect HEAD and the diff.
Preserve existing implementation and distinguish prototypes from shipped changes.

The user is the hardware tester, not the project manager. Own implementation and
reversible design choices. Ask for hardware evidence or consequential subjective
decisions only when needed. Do not restart design discovery each session.

The current UI implementation follows the rail, global lock and working split
design above, subject to the goal clarification at the top of this file.
Apply it at startup, file load and workspace switching. Preserve native editor
instances and state. Bound floating content to actual WINDOW regions, accounting
for variable headers, and align drawing with input. See `docs/IPAD_WORKSPACE.md`
for the current acceptance criteria. Historical handoff entries describe earlier
implementations; they do not override the current contract.

This contract supersedes the earlier custom Scene/Inspector drawer design and the
instruction to prioritize Files over workspace UI. Preserve the existing Files work
and its unfinished lifecycle requirements. Fix confirmed P0 regressions as necessary,
then return to the active milestone. Do not keep expanding the Canvas popover: the
user rejected its location and role as the primary tool surface.

User-approved Pencil mapping: squeeze opens radial tool selection; double tap opens
the context/right-click menu. Do not merge these actions. Preserve the existing
nine-tool ring, its current geometry, touch fallback and desktop input. The workspace
panel milestone does not authorize an unrelated radial redesign.

Checkpoint coherent code and update the handoff with exact build/commit, evidence,
unfinished work and the next implementation step. Source checks, previews, iOS
compilation, packaging and real-device acceptance are separate gates. Do not claim
a task is device-validated because its build succeeds. Avoid repeated unchanged
builds and long build-polling loops with no useful independent work.

Native Files remains required. The user explicitly wants the desktop filesystem
picker removed, including its proposed advanced fallback. Preserve importer options
and library data-block selection through dedicated surfaces, not a Unix browser.
Workspace UI work must not discard unfinished document identity, security scope,
provider coordination, sidecar, cancellation or recovery requirements.
