## Latest user refinement — left rail, global lock and working splits

Latest feedback: the permanent Layout button is rejected and reportedly
interferes with native bottom-panel tabs (Sculpt General/Paint/Simulation).
Remove it from the permanent rail, preserve discoverable workspace editing,
and verify native tab input ownership. Independent subagent UX reviews are
authorized; use them to challenge design and input assumptions.

This section supersedes older right-side Tools/footer launcher/per-edge pin wording.
Keep permanent matching vertical rails on both edges. Tools and bottom-editor/brush
launchers belong on the **left**. Tools opens the actual native narrow vertical
toolbar independently; bottom editors and shelves still open at the **bottom** and
must not overlap Tools. Native Item/Tool/View categories, Scene (Outliner), Inspector
(Properties) and supporting side editors stay on the **right**.

Use one always-reachable circular global panel lock beneath the native navigation
buttons, with an equivalent control in editors lacking that stack. It locks Tools,
side and bottom content together, including panels opened after locking. Switching
content preserves the global lock; unlocking restores ordinary dismissal. Remove
the footer launcher and pin controls. Keep native editor contents and useful saved
sizes; the status bar resumes its original purpose.

Preserve working-editor splits instead of reducing every workspace to one canvas.
Provide horizontal/vertical split, two-axis resizing and panel reordering through
touch-usable controls. These are part of the requested outcome; do not report the
milestone complete after relocating buttons alone. The native Pan/Move navigation
button must accept Pencil press-and-drag just as Zoom does, while preserving direct
finger navigation, external pointer input and the approved radial/Pencil mappings.


Before changing code, read `docs/PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md`, `docs/IPAD_WORKSPACE.md`
and the newest section of `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`, then inspect HEAD and the diff.
Preserve existing implementation and distinguish prototypes from shipped changes.

The user is the hardware tester, not the project manager. Own implementation and
reversible design choices. Ask for hardware evidence or consequential subjective
decisions only when needed. Do not restart design discovery each session.

The active UI contract is the rail, global lock and working split design above.
Apply it at startup, file load and workspace switching. Preserve native editor
instances and state. Bound floating content to actual WINDOW regions, accounting
for variable headers, and align drawing with input. See `docs/IPAD_WORKSPACE.md`
for the current acceptance criteria. Historical handoff entries describe earlier
implementations; they do not override the current contract.

This contract supersedes the earlier custom Scene/Inspector drawer design and the
instruction to prioritize Files over workspace UI. Preserve the existing Files work
and its unfinished lifecycle requirements. Fix confirmed P0 regressions as necessary,
then return to the active milestone. Do not keep expanding the Canvas popover: the
user rejected its location and role as the primary tool surface.

User-approved Pencil mapping: squeeze opens radial tool selection; double tap opens
the context/right-click menu. Do not merge these actions. Preserve the existing
nine-tool ring, its current geometry, touch fallback and desktop input. The workspace
panel milestone does not authorize an unrelated radial redesign.

Checkpoint coherent code and update the handoff with exact build/commit, evidence,
unfinished work and the next implementation step. Source checks, previews, iOS
compilation, packaging and real-device acceptance are separate gates. Do not claim
a task is device-validated because its build succeeds. Avoid repeated unchanged
builds and long build-polling loops with no useful independent work.

Native Files remains required. The user explicitly wants the desktop filesystem
picker removed, including its proposed advanced fallback. Preserve importer options
and library data-block selection through dedicated surfaces, not a Unix browser.
Workspace UI work must not discard unfinished document identity, security scope,
provider coordination, sidecar, cancellation or recovery requirements.
